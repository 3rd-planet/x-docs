import Support from "/components/Support.md"

you can use the following services to deploy your application:

-   [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) - a simple CLI tool for ensuring that a given script runs continuously (i.e. forever)
-   [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) - a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer
-   [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server
-   [supervisor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supervisor) - a supervisor program for running nodejs programs

:::info

The entry point of your application is `app/server.js`

:::

## We recommend using pm2

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

```bash
pm2 start app/server.js -i 0 --name "app"
```

-i 0 will start the maximum number of instances possible based on the number of CPU cores.
You can also specify the number of instances to start.
you can read more about multi-core processing [here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/cluster-mode/)
