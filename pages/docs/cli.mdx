A CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool is vital in any project because it offers efficient, scriptable, and automation-friendly access to an application's functionality. It simplifies tasks for developers, enhancing productivity, ease of use, and scalability while providing a standardized interface for interacting with the project.

Framework X provides a CLI tool that can be used to build components to fasten you work flow. It is based on the [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) package.

## Usage

The CLI tool can be used by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
node x <command> [options]
```

## Commands

The following commands are available:

- `build:command` - Build a new command
- `build:controller` - Build a new controller
- `build:middleware` - Build a new middleware
- `build:repository` - Build a new repository
- `build:validator` - Build a new validator, based on [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)
- `publish:stubs` - Publish the stubs to the `stubs` folder. This is useful when you want to customize the stubs for the CLI tool.

## Help

To get help on the CLI tool, run the following command:

```bash
node x --help
```

## Examples

### Build a new controller

```bash
node x build:controller user
```
The above command will create a new controller file `controllers/user.controller.js` with the following content:

```js
const { successResponse } = require("../helpers/methods")

/**
 *
 * @param req
 * @param res
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
exports.index = async (req, res) => {
    res.send(
        successResponse("controller index", {
            data: "here comes you payload..."
        })
    )
}
```

### Build a new repository

```bash
node x build:repository user
```

The above command will create an empty repository file `repositories/user.repository.js`.
