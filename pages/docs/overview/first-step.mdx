The first step symbolizes initiation, pushing us from inertia to action. It lays the foundation for progress, learning, and achievement. Taking that initial stride requires courage, setting the tone for the journey ahead. Even the grandest accomplishments begin with a single, crucial step, underscoring its profound significance. So, let's get started and take that first step!

## Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> **Note:** You can use any package manager of your choice, once Node.js is installed. **npm, pnpm, and yarn** are the most popular ones.

## Setup

Setup for Framework X is simple. Just run the following command in your terminal and follow the prompts.

```bash
npx @3rdplanet/framework-x
```
